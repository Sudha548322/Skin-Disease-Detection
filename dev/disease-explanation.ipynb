      "Treatment: Mild acne: Topical anti-acne agents,such as benzoyl peroxide,azelaic acid,and tretinoin or adapalene gel. New bioactive proteins may also prove successful. Low-dose combined oral contraceptive. Antiseptic or keratolytic washes containing salicylic acid. Light/laser therapy. Moderate acne: As for mild acne plus a tetracycline such as doxycycline 50–200 mg daily for 6 months or so. Erythromycin or trimethoprim if doxycycline intolerant. Antiandrogen therapy with long-term cyproterone acetate + ethinylestradiol or spironolactone may be considered in women not responding to low-dose combined oral contraceptive,particularly for women with polycystic ovaries. Isotretinoin is often used if acne is persistent or treatment-resistant. Severe acne: Referral to a dermatologist. If fever,arthralgia,bone pain,ulcerated or extensive skin lesions,blood count should be arranged and referral is urgent. Oral antibiotics are often used in higher doses than normal. Oral isotretinoin is usually recommended in suitable patients\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Note: None\n",

      "Cause: Acne is due to a combination of factors. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Familial tendency,Endogenous and exogenous androgenic hormones,Acne bacterial,Innate immune activation with inflammatory mediators,Distension and occlusion of the hair follicles. Flares of acne can be provoked by: Polycystic ovarian disease. Drugs: steroids,hormones,anticonvulsants,epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and others. Application of occlusive cosmetics. High environmental humidity. Diet high in dairy products and high glycaemic foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms: Acne is often confined to the face but it may involve the neck,chest,and back. It is characterised by: Open and closed uninflamed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Inflamed papules and pustules. In severe acne,nodules and pseudocysts. Post-inflammatory erythematous or pigmented macules and scars. Adverse social and psychological effects. Severity is classified as mild,moderate,or severe.Mild acne: total lesion count <30. Moderate acne: total lesion count 30–125. Severe acne: total lesion count >125\n",
