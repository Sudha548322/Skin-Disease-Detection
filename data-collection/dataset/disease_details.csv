"acanthosis-nigricans","Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterised by a velvety papillomatous overgrowth of the epidermis. Darkening and thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin occurs mainly in the flexural areas,particularly the axillae,groins,inframammary regions,and the neck. Acanthosis nigricans is usually a sign of an underlying condition or disease,such as obesity or diabetes (benign). Its presence as a sign of internal malignancy is very rare.","The diagnosis is made clinically,including a thorough history of current and past medical conditions,family history,and medications.If there is diagnostic uncertainty,abiopsycan be sent forhistopathologicalanalysis and confirmation. Abrupt onset in a thin individual should alert the physician to the possibility of an underlying malignancy; prompting an appropriate history,examination,and investigations.","Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis: occurs more commonly in females with a mean age of 18–21 years. Reticulation is heterogenous instead of homogenous as seen in acanthosis nigricans. Pigmentation is not associated with peripheral reticulation in acanthosis nigricans.Erythrasma: characterized by well-demarcated red patches with possible scaling,found mainly in the intertriginous regions. A Wood lamp exam showing coral-red fluorescence is helpful in distinguishing it. Intertrigo: characterised by erythematous patches with possible pruritis and tenderness. It is nonspecific inflammation that is worsened by humidity. History of pruritus and morphology are helpful distinguishing features. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation: this is localised and site-specific to the skin inflammation,and often there is a history of skin trauma or irritation. Tinea versicolor: hyperpigmented tinea versicolor presenting on the neck can be confused with acanthosis nigricans. Differentiation can be made by skin scale direct mycology.","The mainstay treatment is to manage the underlying disease. Patient education is also an important component. General measures: Non-pharmacological treatment can include lifestyle modifications such as a establishing a healthy diet,increasing exercise to help attenuate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Metformin and rosiglitazone have been used to reduce insulin levels and moderately improve the lesions. Malignant acanthosis nigricans should be managed with careful workup and management of the malignancy. Cyproheptadine can aid in the regression of acanthosis nigricans associated with malignancy because it inhibits the release of tumour-produced substances. Withdrawal of the suspected drug can help in resolving drug-induced acanthosis nigricans. Syndromic acanthosis nigricans can be improved with treatment of underlying syndrome. For example,use of oral contraceptives for polycystic ovary syndrome. Treatment of acanthosis nigricans lesions can also be undertaken for cosmetic reasons. Pharmacological treatment modalities can include: Keratolytic agents: salicylic acid,glycolic acid,or trichloroacetic acid. Topical retinoids: adapalene gel,or tretinoin cream. Calcipotriol. Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil). Podophyllin. Procedural modalities include: Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA). Dermabrasion. Long-pulsed alexandrite laser therapy.","Acanthosis nigricans affects < 1% of Caucasians. In the United States,the estimated prevalence is 13% of African Americans,5% of Latinos,and 34% of Native Americans.","It affects both males and females","Affects all ages,with people < 40 years old typically being more affected. Acanthosis nigricans was found in 18% of children and 19% of adults in a cross-sectional study (n=1730) in the United States.","Those diagnosed with acanthosis nigricans were twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes than those without (35% vs. 17%). Rarely,there is a link with an internal malignancy. Patients with malignant acanthosis nigricans tend to be middle-aged,not obese,and lesions develop abruptly.","The exact cause is still unclear,however it is predominantly linked to states of insulin resistance where obesity,diabetes,or metabolic disorders (eg,metabolic syndrome,polycystic ovary syndrome,generalised lipodystrophy) co-exist. Insulin crosses the dermal-epidermal junction and,in high concentrations,can have growth-stimulating effects through its binding to type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGFRs) on keratinocytes. This stimulates the proliferation of these cells,leading to acanthosis nigricans.","Symmetric,thickened,brown,velvety patches and plaques of skin that appear: Most commonly in the intertriginous areas: axillae,groin,and back of the neck. On the nipples,areolae,vulva,and perineum in women. On the mucous membranes of the oral cavity,nasal and laryngeal mucosa and oesophagus; these lesions tend to be greater in extent and severity in malignant acanthosis nigricans Skin tags are common on cutaneous and mucosal surfaces Lesions may become macerated or malodorous Pruritus may be present and is very common in malignant acanthosis nigricans. The skin may appear darker and leathery in darker skin phenotypes. People with skin phototype IV have a higher frequency of acanthosis nigricans on the neck compared to those with skin phototypes II and III. There is a very high certainty of insulin resistance in people with light skin that have acanthosis nigricans. However,in people with skin of colour,acanthosis nigricans can be present without concurrent insulin resistance. Therefore,the skin phenotype influences the likelihood of acanthosis nigricans being a predictor of insulin resistance.","Cosmetic disfigurement. Psychological distress. Acanthosis nigricans is an independent risk factor for the presence of diabetes. Complications associated with underlying disease,for example,obesity-associated complications.","Outcomes depend on the cause. If the underlying etiology can be addressed eg,weight loss,then the acanthosis nigricans can resolve. Obesity,metabolic syndrome,and diabetes have deleterious effects on overall morbidity and mortality. Hereditary acanthosis may stabilise and even regress spontaneously in some cases. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is associated with a poorer prognosis (average survival time is 2 years) with early mortality often due to advanced cancer.","None"
"achenbach-syndrome","Achenbach syndrome is a paroxysmal recurring painful bruising of the finger(s) or palm, not associated with serious underlying conditions.","Achenbach syndrome is diagnosed clinically on the typical history and clinical presentation. Many patients have undergone exhaustive investigations for clotting disorders and ischaemic events,all of which are normal/negative.","Bruising due to clotting disorders or low platelet count. Capillary fragility due to vitamin C deficiency or amyloidosis. Vascular ischaemic events such as embolism or vascular spasm.","Minimise known triggers. Analgesia if needed. Avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elevation and cooling for swelling. Reassurance. There is no specific treatment.","Although said to be rare,a study of 802 members of the general population aged 18 to 84 years in three regions of France found a prevalence of 12% in women and 1% of men. Achenbach syndrome has been reported in Caucasians and Asians. The discolouration may be less obvious in skin of colour.","reported in females","median age of onset of 48–50 years (range 22–76)","It is possibly more common in those with a history of Raynaud phenomenon and chilblains,however is not associated with smoking.","Achenbach syndrome is a subcutaneous bruise probably due to minor fragility of capillaries or a small vein in the palmar skin. Preceding minor trauma may be recalled in 30% of cases such as sweeping,handwashing of clothing,or cycling. There is no associated serious cause for easy bruising such as a clotting disorder or vascular abnormality.","Achenbach syndrome characteristically follows minor trauma,although this is often not recalled. Acute onset of pain followed minutes to hours later by discolouration,usually blue-purple.Palmar aspect of the dominant hand is the most common site. Second and third finger involvement is commonest,although any finger,toe,or palmar site can be affected. Sparing of the fingertip and nail bed is characteristic. Discolouration resolves spontaneously in 3–6 days (range 2–14 days),without going through the colour changes usually seen with a resolving bruise. Other — swelling; itch,burning or numbness; involvement of the dorsal digit; limited movement. Normal findings — radial and ulnar pulses; skin perfusion; skin temperature; nail bed capillaroscopy.","None","Achenbach syndrome is a benign condition with spontaneous resolution of lesions without sequelae. Episodes can recur with minor trauma,with an average frequency of recurrences of 1 per year.", "None"
"acne","Acne is a common chronic disorder affecting the hair follicle and sebaceous gland,in which there is expansion and blockage of the follicle and inflammation. There are several variants.","In most cases,tests are unnecessary. If features are atypical consider: Skin swabs for microscopy and culture Hormonal tests in females.","None","Mild acne: Topical anti-acne agents,such as benzoyl peroxide,azelaic acid,and tretinoin or adapalene gel. New bioactive proteins may also prove successful. Low-dose combined oral contraceptive. Antiseptic or keratolytic washes containing salicylic acid. Light/laser therapy. Moderate acne: As for mild acne plus a tetracycline such as doxycycline 50–200 mg daily for 6 months or so. Erythromycin or trimethoprim if doxycycline intolerant. Antiandrogen therapy with long-term cyproterone acetate + ethinylestradiol or spironolactone may be considered in women not responding to low-dose combined oral contraceptive,particularly for women with polycystic ovaries. Isotretinoin is often used if acne is persistent or treatment-resistant. Severe acne: Referral to a dermatologist. If fever,arthralgia,bone pain,ulcerated or extensive skin lesions,blood count should be arranged and referral is urgent. Oral antibiotics are often used in higher doses than normal. Oral isotretinoin is usually recommended in suitable patients","all races and ethnicities.","male and female","It is prevalent in adolescents and young adults,with 85% of 16 to 18 year-olds affected. However,it may sometimes occur in children and adults of all ages.","None","Acne is due to a combination of factors. The exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Familial tendency,Endogenous and exogenous androgenic hormones,Acne bacterial,Innate immune activation with inflammatory mediators,Distension and occlusion of the hair follicles. Flares of acne can be provoked by: Polycystic ovarian disease. Drugs: steroids,hormones,anticonvulsants,epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and others. Application of occlusive cosmetics. High environmental humidity. Diet high in dairy products and high glycaemic foods.","Acne is often confined to the face but it may involve the neck,chest,and back. It is characterised by: Open and closed uninflamed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Inflamed papules and pustules. In severe acne,nodules and pseudocysts. Post-inflammatory erythematous or pigmented macules and scars. Adverse social and psychological effects. Severity is classified as mild,moderate,or severe.Mild acne: total lesion count <30. Moderate acne: total lesion count 30–125. Severe acne: total lesion count >125","None","Acne tends to improve after the age of 25 years but may persist,especially in females. Treatment with isotretinoin can lead to long-term remission in many patients.","None."
"acral-lentiginous-melanoma","Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a rare subtype of melanoma arising on the palms, soles, or under the nails. It is also known as acral melanoma. In early stages, ALM often appears as a dark brown or black macule with variegated colour, and can be nodular and ulcerated in advanced cases. ALM is slow-growing, and can take months to years to become invasive, ie, to grow beyond the basement membrane of the epidermis where it originates.","The diagnosis is often made on clinical history and presentation, supported by dermoscopy. The following features are seen on dermoscopy for acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM): Parallel ridge pattern in early phases, Lack of features typical of acral naevi (fibrillary, lattice-like, parallel furrow patterns), Blotches, Asymmetry, Multiple colours, Diffuse pigmentation of the nail/stripes on the nail/nail ulceration. Definitive diagnosis is made with histopathology after excision or biopsy of the lesion. Staging is conducted as for any other cutaneous melanoma, with histopathological features such as Breslow depth, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node status. Histological features of ALM include an asymmetrical proliferation of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction.","The differential diagnosis for acral lentiginous melanoma is broad and includes the following: Acral naevi (either congenital or acquired), Trauma-related haemorrhage, Calcaneal petechiae (talon noir), Tinea nigra, Soil/stain. Of note, pigmented actinic keratoses and seborrhoeic keratoses do not occur on acral surfaces. Amelanocytic or hypomelanocytic lesions may mimic benign diseases such as warts, calluses, or benign tumours such as poromas.","General measures: Education of health professionals and the public. Regular skin examinations. Multidisciplinary management with a podiatrist and occupational therapist where available. Specific measures: The mainstay of treatment for acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is wide local excision. Further treatment depends mainly on the Breslow thickness of the lesion. After initial excision biopsy, the radial excision margins, measured clinically from the edge of the melanoma, are: In-situ lesions: 0.5–1 cm margin, Breslow depth <1 mm: 1 cm margin, Breslow depth 1–2mm: 1–2 cm margin, Breslow depth >2mm: 2 cm margin. A skin graft or a flap may be needed to close the wound, or in some cases, partial amputation of a digit. If further treatment is required following excision, this may involve radiotherapy or immunotherapy.","However, ALM is the most common subtype of melanoma in darker skinned populations, accounting for 40–60% of melanoma diagnoses in Asian and African-American ethnicities. It is the least common subtype of melanoma in Caucasian populations.","Males and females are equally affected.","The incidence of ALM increases with age, with the average age of diagnosis being 63 years.","Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the least common subtype of melanoma diagnosed overall, accounting for 2–3% of melanoma diagnoses. Females tend to be diagnosed earlier than males.","Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) usually arises de novo, but there are rare reports of acral melanoma arising from a pre-existing melanocytic naevus. The cause of ALM is not fully understood. Unlike other subtypes of melanoma, sun exposure does not appear to be a risk factor for its development, however, there are rare case reports demonstrating an ultraviolet signature as in other types of cutaneous melanoma. Suggested aetiologies of the cause for ALM include: Stress/shearing forces on the foot. Genetic mutations, including KIT, BRAF, NRAS, NF1, cyclin D1, CDKN2A, and MYC. The pathogenesis for melanoma includes overgrowth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells found deep in the epidermis.","In early stages, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) presents as a new light to dark brown pigmented macule on the palm, sole, or under a nail that follow the skin ridges. ALM is more commonly seen on the feet, possibly due to higher melanocyte density. Occasionally, ALM can present as an amelanotic or hypomelanotic lesion. These are difficult to diagnose as they often mimic benign diseases such as warts or calluses. Subungual melanoma arises from the nail matrix and usually presents as a longitudinal brown or black band in the fingernail or toenail. It may be associated with nail dystrophy. Involvement of the proximal nail fold (Hutchinson’s sign) is considered a clue to the diagnosis. Suspicious features for invasive melanoma: Nodular or darkly pigmented appearance. Ulceration. Pruritus. Increasing number of colours, particularly blue and black. Pigment extending from under the nail to beyond the nail fold. >7mm in size.","Clinical features do not vary significantly between skin types. It may be more difficult to visualise naevus structure on dermoscopy in darker skin types, appearing as a more homogenous colour. Complications of untreated disease: Progressive disease including distal metastasis. Complications of surgical management: Scarring, Skin contractures, Digital amputation, Phantom limb pain, Functional impairment, Loss of nail/s.","Compared with cutaneous melanoma, most studies suggest that acral lentiginous melanoma has a poorer prognosis, with diagnosis often occurring at a more advanced clinical stage. It is unclear if this is solely due to delay in ALM detection due to the difficulty in monitoring such sites (eg, soles of the feet), or is also a consequence of genetic and biological differences that promote tumour aggressiveness. The outcome of ALM depends primarily on Breslow thickness of the lesion and staging, including sentinel lymph node involvement. Other factors that may influence prognosis include age and gender.","While there are no known preventative strategies, regular skin checks and general sun protection are recommended. Any new lesions noted on the palms, soles, or under the nails should be reviewed by a medical professional."
"actinic-keratosis","Actinic keratosis is a precancerous scaly spot found on sun-damaged skin, also known as solar keratosis. It may be considered an early form of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (a keratinocyte cancer).","Actinic keratosis is usually easy to diagnose clinically or by dermoscopy (see actinic keratosis dermoscopy). Occasionally, a biopsy is necessary, for example, to exclude SCC, or if treatment fails.","None","Actinic keratoses are usually removed because they are unsightly or uncomfortable, or because of the risk that skin cancer may develop in them. The latter point is a matter of considerable debate, and the most robust studies (Cochrane review) did not find convincing evidence that AK treatment resulted in a prevention of invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Treatment of an actinic keratosis requires removal of the defective skin cells. Epidermis regenerates from surrounding or follicular keratinocytes that have escaped sun damage. Some AKs will resolve with the frequent and appropriate use of sunscreens. Tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratoses should be treated aggressively. Asymptomatic flat keratoses may not require active treatment but should be kept under observation. 1. Physical treatments: Physical treatments are used to destroy individual keratoses that are generally symptomatic or have a thick hard surface scale. The lesions may recur in time, in which case they may be retreated by the same or a different method. 2. Cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen: Liquid nitrogen spray is required to achieve adequate depth and duration of the freeze. This varies according to lesion location, width, and thickness. Healing varies from 5–10 days on the face, 3–4 weeks on the hands, and 6 weeks or longer on the legs. A light freeze for a superficial actinic keratosis usually leaves no mark, but longer freeze times result in hypopigmentation or scar. 3. Shave, curettage and electrocautery: Shave, curettage (scraping with a sharp instrument) and electrocautery (burning) may be necessary to remove a cutaneous horn or hypertrophic actinic keratosis. Healing of the wound takes several weeks or longer, depending on the body site. The specimen is sent for histological examination. 4. Excision: Excision ensures the actinic keratosis has been completely removed, which should be confirmed by pathology. The surgical wound is sutured (stitched). The sutures are removed after a few days, the time depending on the size and location of the lesion. The procedure leaves a permanent scar. 5. Field treatments: Creams are used to treat areas of sun damage and flat actinic keratoses, sometimes after physical treatments have been carried out. Field treatments are most effective on facial skin. Pretreatment with keratolytics (such as urea cream, salicylic acid ointment or topical retinoid), and thorough skin cleansing improves response rates. Results are variable and the course of treatment may need repeating from time to time. With the exception of diclofenac gel, field treatments all result in local inflammatory reactions such as redness, blistering and discomfort for a varying length of time. Diclofenac is more often used as an anti-inflammatory drug. A special gel formulation (3%) in a base containing sodium hyaluronate) is applied twice daily for 3 months, it is fairly well tolerated in the treatment of actinic keratoses, but less effective than the other options listed here. Piroxicam - similar to diclofenac. 5-Fluorouracil is a cytotoxic agent. The cream formulation is applied once or twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks. Its effect may be enhanced by calcipotriol ointment. 5-fluorouracil may be available as a combination product along with salicylic acid.Skin peels using trichloroacetic acid or Jessner solution. Imiquimod cream is an immune response modifier. It is applied 2 or 3 times weekly for 4 to 16 weeks. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves applying a photosensitiser (a porphyrin chemical such as methyl aminolevulinic acid) to the affected area prior to exposing it to a source of visible light. Tirbanibulin is a synthetic inhibitor of tubulin polymerisation and protein kinase signalling. This 5 day topical treatment received a product license in countries such as the USA, UK, and Germany in 2021. Oral retinoids have been used in organ transplant recipients and are shown to reduce the risk of SCC development in those with numerous AKs.","Actinic keratoses affect people that have often lived in the tropics or subtropics and have predisposing factors such as: Other signs of photoageing skin. Fair skin with a history of sunburn. History of long hours spent outdoors for work or recreation. Defective immune system. However, even in temperate climates they may be common - in southern Ireland and North west England up to 25% of people aged 60 years and over have at least one.","Both male and female","Around 60 years","None","Actinic keratoses are the result of abnormal skin cell development due to DNA damage by short wavelength UVB. They are more likely to appear if the immune function is poor, due to ageing, recent sun exposure, predisposing disease, or certain drugs.","Actinic keratosis may be solitary but there are often multiple keratoses. The appearance varies. A flat or thickened papule, or plaque. White or yellow; scaly, warty, or horny surface. Skin coloured, red, or pigmented. Tender or asymptomatic. They are sometimes graded according to their appearance: Grade 1: Mild pink or grey marks with slight scale and gritty to touch. Grade 2: Moderate thicker hyperkeratosis and easily detected. Grade 3: Severe hyperkeratotic thick keratin. Grade 4: Confluent areas several centimetres with a range of the above grades of AK. Actinic keratoses are very common on sites repeatedly exposed to the sun, especially the backs of the hands and the face, most often affecting the ears, nose, cheeks, upper lip, vermilion of the lower lip, temples, forehead, and balding scalp. In severely chronically sun-damaged individuals, they may also be found on the upper trunk, upper and lower limbs, and dorsum of feet.","The main concern is that actinic keratoses indicate an increased risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. It is rare for a solitary actinic keratosis to evolve to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but the risk of SCC occurring at some stage in a patient with more than 10 actinic keratoses is thought to be about 10 to 15%. A tender, thickened, ulcerated, or enlarging actinic keratosis is suspicious of evolution to SCC. Cutaneous horn may arise from an underlying actinic keratosis or SCC. Because they are sun damaged, people with actinic keratoses are also at risk of developing actinic cheilitis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC, which is more common than SCC), melanoma, and rare forms of skin cancer such as Merkel cell carcinoma.","Actinic keratoses may recur months or years after treatment. The same treatment can be repeated or another method used. Patients who have been treated for actinic keratoses are at risk of developing new keratoses. They are also at increased risk of other skin cancers, especially intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma, invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma.","Actinic keratoses are prevented by strict sun protection. If already present, actinic keratoses may improve with a very high sun protection factor (50+) broad-spectrum sunscreen applied at least daily to affected areas, year-round. The number and severity of actinic keratoses can also be reduced by taking nicotinamide (vitamin B3) 500 mg twice daily."
